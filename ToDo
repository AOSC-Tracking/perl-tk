Tk::Tree has a dual live on CPAN. Incorporate the 4.3 version.

Support for some OpenDesktop window manager standards, like setting
icons through _NET_WM_ICON or using utf8 window titles.

Port more Tcl/Tk tests to Perl/Tk (text.test etc.)

messageBox fixes: <Return> does not use the currently selected button,
but always the default button, which seems not untuitive. Also, the
Tcl/Tk counterpart has nicer colored bitmaps, port them to Perl/Tk.

Check all Tk-related bugs on rt.cpan.org (some are already fixed).

Tk::FBox should deal with 8bit characters in filenames (i.e. use byte
semantics in filesystem operations, maybe use system encoding when
displaying filenames, but with graceful degradation).

What about getOpen/SaveFile and Windows, are there also encoding
issues with filenames?

Incorporate latest unix/tkUnixWm.c from Tcl/Tk sources (has a lot of
OpenDesktop support).

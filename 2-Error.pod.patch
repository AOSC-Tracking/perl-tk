 The B<Tk> module includes a default B<Tk::Error> subroutine
 that simply reports the error on stderr.
 
-An alternate definition is provided via :
+=head1 Tk::ErrorDialog
+
+An alternate definition is provided via:
 
 S<    >C<require Tk::ErrorDialog;>
 
 that posts a dialog box containing the error message and offers
 the user a chance to see a stack trace showing where the
 error occurred.
+
+This is an OO implementation of the Tcl/Tk command B<bgerror>, with a
+twist: since there is only one B<ErrorDialog> widget, you aren't required
+to invoke the constructor to create it; it will be created
+automatically when the first background error occurs.  However, in
+order to configure the I<-cleanupcode> and I<-appendtraceback>
+B<ErrorDialog> options you must call the constructor and create it
+manually.
+
+The B<ErrorDialog> object essentially consists of two subwidgets: a
+B<Dialog> widget to display the background error and a B<Text> widget
+for the traceback information.  If required, you can invoke various
+widget methods to customize these subwidgets - their advertised names
+are described below.
+
+S<    >I<$mw>-E<gt>B<ErrorDialog>(-cleanupcode => I<code>, -appendtraceback => I<bool>);
+
+$mw is a window reference.
+
+I<code> is a CODE reference if special post-background error
+processing is required (default is undefined). The callback subroutine
+is called with @_ having the same arguments that B<Tk::Error> was
+invoked with.
+
+I<bool> is a boolean indicating whether or not to append successive
+tracebacks (default is 1, do append).
+
+=head2 Advertised ErrorDialog widgets
+
+I<error_dialog> is the Dialog widget reference.
+
+I<text> is the Text widget reference containing the traceback information.

This is a *binary* distribution of Tk-402.003 for Perl 5.004_55 on OS/2.

	Note that Perl/Tk can be build in 3 different flavors on OS/2:
		PM, Open32 and XFree86
	This distribution contains a native OS/2 PM build.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~

This distribution uses a new form of packaging, so it may be installed via 
CPAN, as usual (but without a need for any additional utility except Perl!):

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	CPAN> install Tk::OS2bin

or
	perl -MCPAN -e "install 'Tk::OS2bin'"

(substitute install => test if you want to just test it).  However, you
need *a cleanly installed* Perl to do so (either binary installer should run 
to completion, or you need to edit config.sys and .../Config.pm manually).

You can check the quality of your install via running
	testperl.cmd
(in perl_utl subdistribution).

If you did download and unzip this package manually, you can test it via

	make test

or (equivalently)

	perl -Mblib basic_demo
	perl -Mblib demos/widget

(or substitute any other of many test scripts included in this distribution).  

You can manually install it via

	make install

(as with the above `make test' line, no "make" utility is necessary!).

You can manually uninstall it via

	make uninstall

(empty directories and a renamed .packlist file are left behind, though...)

DOCUMENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation in MAN format is included with this distribution.  
Documentation in .INF format is avalable from CPAN somewhere in
	$CPAN/authors/id/ILYAZ/
probably in tk_inf.zip.

BUGS
~~~~

With a few exceptions noted below:

 All the bugs in the X and/or Win32 version of Perl/Tk are present here.
 All the bugs in the Illya Vaes's port of TCL/Tk for OS/2 are present here.

Additionally, capture/release methods of Tix, and TmpLines routine of Tix
are not supported.

Bugs fixed: font handling and keyboard handling of Illya Vaes's port are
	    *greatly* improved.
	    Minor improvements to Tk's menus and tkman2pod.

Patches: 
	included in tk_os2_patches.zip in this distribution.

Compiling:
	Put directories Tk-402.* and Tk-OS2-1.0* alongslide, apply
	patch_ptk_generic to Tk (if 402.003) and diff_keys to Tk/pTk/mTk/os2/*
	Do
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
	in Tk-402.* directory

List of files to include into this binary distribution was generated by:
		pfind . /\.t$/ "$dir !~ /pTk|blib|tkGlue/"
		pfind . "=~ /^#!.*perl/" "=~ /use\s+Tk\b/"
        with an addition of ./blib/*

CHANGES
~~~~~~~
01:	Fileevents should work.
	Added a module Tk::OS2bin to make installation simpler (works?).
02:	The main name-creating file Tk/OS2bin.pm was not included!
03:	Resources were not added to the DLL, thus the cursors would not show.

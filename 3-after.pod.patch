+=head2 Internal Details
+
 The internal Tk::After class has the following synopsis:
 
-  $id = Tk::After->new($widget,$time,'once',callback);
-  $id = Tk::After->new($widget,$time,'repeat',callback);
+  $id = Tk::After->new($widget, tid, $time, 'once',   callback);
+  $id = Tk::After->new($widget, tid, $time, 'repeat', callback);
   $id->cancel;
+  $id->time(?delay?);
+
+$id is a Tk::After object, an array of 5 elements:	
+
+I<$widget> is the parent widget reference.
+
+I<tid> is the internal timer id, a unique string.
+
+I<$time> is the string 'idle', representing an idle queue timer, or a
+integer millisecond value.
+ 
+I<once> or I<repeat> specifies whether the timer is a one-time B<after>
+event, or a repeating B<repeat> event.
+
+I<callback> specifies a Perl/Tk Tk::Callback object.
+
+=head1 Changing a B<repeat> timer interval 
+
+It's posible to change a B<repeat> timer's delay value, or even cancel
+any timer, using the B<time> method. If I<delay> is specified and
+non-zero, a new timer delay is established.  If I<delay> is zero the
+timer event is canceled just as if I<$id>-E<gt>B<cancel> were invoked.
+In all cases the current millisecond timer delay is returned.
+
+Note: the new timer delay will take effect on the I<subsequent> timer
+event - this command will not cancel the pending timer event and
+re-issue it with the new delay time.
